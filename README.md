# facebookapi

Thanks Facebook for deprecating API access that would allow these modules to run.

Page-to-Node would allow for all information from a Page to be entered into Drupal as a new node. Still had some warts, but access was cut off so it's now dead.

Events would gather a list of all nodes of Facebook pages and create an event in Drupal.

These two modules together were used to build city and event guides. Alas, no mas.
